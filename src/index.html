    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My programming journey began when I was 22 years old. At that time, I was curious how websites work 
        and started to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and play with static websites. Later, I discover 
        a diverse ecosystem of Javascript through frameworks like React and Vue. 
        Next, I dive into the server-side programming and encounter with Node.js and Python. 
        I have gained valuable experiences in web development that laid the foundation
        for the next part of my journey.

        I have come to the concept of "hacking" when I watched videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010">John Hammond</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflow">LiveOverflow</a>. Following their advices, I participate in CTFs like
        picoCTF, DownUnderCTF, ... and also practice with HackTheBox. To improve web exploitation skill, I use Webgoat as a learning platform.
        I'm also interested in binary exploitation with many challenges from pwnable.kr and pwnable.tw.
        There are many things to learn about Cyber Security and this is just the beginning.
